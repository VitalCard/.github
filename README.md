# Organization Community Health Files

Welcome to the `.github` repository for Vital Card. This repository contains default community health files such as issue templates, pull request templates etc that are shared across all repositories within our organization.

## What's Inside

This repository includes the following shared GitHub community health files:

- **Issue Templates**: Pre-formatted templates for different types of issues, such as bug reports, feature requests, and custom templates for our specific workflow needs.
- **Pull Request Templates**: Templates that outline the standard process for opening pull requests and remind contributors of the checks they need to go through.

## How to Use Templates

When you create a new issue or pull request in any repository within our organization, you will have the option to choose from the available templates. Simply click on the template you wish to use, and it will auto-populate the issue or pull request body for you to fill out.

## Contributing to These Files

We encourage team contributions to these templates and guidelines. To propose a change:

1. Clone the repository or edit the file directly on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your modifications and commit them with a clear, descriptive message.
4. Open a pull request detailing the changes and the rationale behind them.
